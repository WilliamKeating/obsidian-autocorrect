# Obsidian Autocorrect

An Obsidian plug-in that autocorrects spelling errors. When the enter/return key is pressed the plugin will replace the previous line with the corrected text. This plugin requires a Groq.com API Key to function. It currently uses Llama 3.3 70b for spelling correction. Considering this uses an LLM, hallucinations may occasionally occur. While a smaller model could be used Llama 70b is currently extremely affordable and I have found it follows directions better than other models. Groq currently has a very generous free tier which should allow you to use this plugin for free indefinitely. Llama is instructed to only correct spelling but minor punctuation errors are often also fixed.
